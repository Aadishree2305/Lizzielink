        Legend Says:
        <br>
        Elizabeth Andrew Borden was born in the fall river massachusetts in 1860
and was the second daughter of Sarah and
Andrew Jackson Warden. 
They were a pretty wealthy family and
one of the most important ones in the region,
however when lacy was very little her
biological mother passed away.
She lived for a while with her father
Andrew and her sister Emma. 
He owned several businesses but even 
then his family lived frugally 
and it is believed that he was a very 
austere man who barely showed any signs of affection. 
A few years after Andrew's wife passed 
away he got married with Abby Dorothy Gray,  
a woman from humble origins who could 
never earn the love of Andrew's daughters
from the beginning the little ones never 
accepted their father's new wife 
which resulted in a very uncomfortable 
environment in their house. 
Abby tried hard to be liked by the girls 
,but nothing made them change their mind ,and
everything got worse when Andrew decided that they would all
move to a new home the new neighborhood  
would be closer to Andrew's businesses 
but the girls didn't like that place 
at all they begged him to please have 
them move somewhere else but he didn't accept and that really complicated everything 
that wouldn't be the last problem the family would be facing over the years ,their relationship
deteriorated to the point that they barely 
spent any time together in the last 
straw was when Andrew bought a property and 
legally transferred its ownership to his 
wife Abby. 
This enraged the daughters who felt denigrated by that gesture
shortly after tragedy came 
August 4th 1892. It started like a normal 
day for the borden family
Emma was suspended a few days in a
friend's house and Andrew had to go to 
the bank to sort out some issues 
however due to a strong stomach pain 
,that he and his wife had been suffering 
for a few days he had to go back home earlier the homemade was also out of the house 
and once she arrived back,
she rose to the living room after 
hearing lazy screams.
The young lady said that a burglar broke 
into the house and 
killed her father. His body had many
wounds made with a sharp weapon
and his head was completely destroyed
showing part of his cranium.
The maid were asked to tell Abby but
when she arrived to the guest room,
she witnessed practically the same scene 
as before Abby was dead covered in blood and with
multiple cuts all over her body. Lizzie told the police that she had been in the attic the
entire time and had no idea about what 
happened the agents then determined that the cuts 
of the bodies had been made with an 
ax the agents then continued 
investigating the crime and after 
inspecting the Boreham house. They found 
two axes and noticed how one of them had 
been thoroughly cleaned recently. There were many pieces of evidence which 
pointed to her being the culprit 
the ax found in the house coincided 
with the wounds and the maid 
talked about Lizzie's bad relationship 
with her stepmother,  
moreover a neighbor declared to have 
seen Lizzie borrowing a blue dress a few 
days after the crime  
in a merchant accused her of wanting to buy poison. 
Despite all of this the judge declared her innocent just because he considered that
a Christian woman like her couldn't have possibly committed such a crime.
Lizzie and her sister abandoned their
family house bought another one in the downtown area and lived together until a fight resulted in them going separate ways.
Lizzie became Lisbeth and died alone due to pneumonia in 1927 at the age of 66.
Her sister Emma passed away nine days later in her own house.
The story of Andrews and Abby's murders became very famous.<br><br>
